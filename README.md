# Next.js 15 Unhandled Error During Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 related to unhandled exceptions during data fetching. The application appears to work correctly under normal conditions but fails silently or throws an unclear error if data fetching fails.

## Problem Description

The `pages/index.js` file contains a minimal Next.js application.  While this example is simple, it highlights a potential issue where data fetching errors are not properly handled, leading to unexpected behavior and lack of informative error messages.  This is especially relevant when dealing with asynchronous operations and external API calls.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to implement robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and appropriate logging to make debugging easier.  This allows you to provide more informative feedback to the user and simplifies the debugging process.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe the behavior (the provided example doesn't include actual data fetching; you'll need to add that to truly test the error handling).
